Things To Research
==================

A framework for permissions in a REST API. Is there such a thing? Could
such a thing be written? This could be a good idea space for a library.

*Scikit-Learn* looks absolutely fucking awesome. Play with this. A lot.

[Abstract Base Class](https://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html) I had
no idea python could do this. That's cool.
